1. The program guesses the solution in less than 20 guesses in every case except the worst case scenario, (6, 10, 6).
	Theory 1 always results in 1 guess, 2 in 20 guesses, and 3 results in anything from 1-20.
2. It is nice that the algorithm manages to guess within twenty tries, but it is unfortunate that the farther away from
	(1, 1, 1) you are in your solution, the longer it is going to take to solve that solution, (6, 10, 6) being the farthest.
